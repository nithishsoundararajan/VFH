# **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)**

**Project Name:** n8n Workflow to Standalone Codebase Converter
**Prepared By:** \Nithish S
**Date:**25/08/2025
**Version:** 1.0

---

## **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this FRD is to define all functional requirements for converting an n8n workflow JSON into a fully functional, standalone Node.js codebase that executes the workflow without the n8n runtime.

---

## **2. Scope**

**In Scope:**

* Parsing n8n workflow JSON.
* Mapping nodes to official n8n package implementations.
* Generating a standalone Node.js project.
* Executing workflows with correct node sequencing and data passing.
* Configuration via environment variables.

**Out of Scope:**

* Custom GUI or workflow editor.
* Creating new nodes not available in n8n packages.
* Advanced analytics or monitoring dashboards.

| FR1   | Workflow JSON Input      | System must accept an n8n workflow JSON file.                               | JSON file exported from n8n | Parsed workflow object                         | High     |
| FR2   | Node Identification      | Identify all nodes and triggers in the workflow.                            | Parsed workflow JSON        | List of nodes and triggers with configurations | High     |
| FR3   | Node Mapping             | Map each node to its corresponding function in n8n packages.                | Node list                   | Node execution modules                         | High     |
| FR4   | Code Generation          | Generate Node.js scripts for each node and workflow executor.               | Node mapping                | JS modules for each node and workflow          | High     |
| FR5   | Workflow Execution       | Execute nodes in correct sequence, passing data according to connections.   | Node scripts                | Executed workflow with outputs                 | High     |
| FR6   | Trigger Handling         | Support standard n8n triggers (e.g., cron, webhooks) in the generated code. | Trigger configuration       | Node.js trigger functions                      | High     |
| FR7   | Error Handling & Logging | Log execution progress and handle node errors gracefully.                   | Workflow execution          | Console logs, error messages                   | Medium   |
| FR8   | Configuration Management | Support external configuration of credentials and API keys.                 | config.js / .env            | Secure access to APIs                          | Medium   |
| FR9   | Attribution              | Include credit and licensing for n8n and all packages used.                 | N/A                         | README.md with licenses and credits            | High     |
| FR10  | Extensibility            | Allow easy addition of new workflows and nodes.                             | New workflow JSON           | Updated standalone codebase                    | Medium   |

## **4. System Inputs and Outputs**

**Inputs:**

* n8n workflow JSON file.
* Environment variables for credentials and API keys.
* Optional: custom configuration for logging or workflow paths.

**Outputs:**

* Node.js project folder with modular scripts for nodes, triggers, and workflow execution.
* Console logs indicating execution progress and errors.
* README.md with instructions and licensing information.

---

## **5. Use Cases**

1. **UC1: Import Workflow JSON**

   * **Actor:** Developer
   * **Description:** Developer uploads a workflow JSON.
   * **Outcome:** JSON is parsed and validated.

2. **UC2: Map Nodes to Code**

   * **Actor:** System
   * **Description:** Identify node types and map to official n8n package functions.
   * **Outcome:** Node modules are prepared for code generation.

3. **UC3: Generate Standalone Project**

   * **Actor:** System
   * **Description:** Create project structure with node scripts, workflow executor, and main entry point.
   * **Outcome:** Node.js project ready for execution.

4. **UC4: Execute Workflow**

   * **Actor:** Developer / System
   * **Description:** Run the generated codebase; triggers start, nodes execute in order, data flows correctly.
   * **Outcome:** Workflow executes successfully without n8n runtime.

5. **UC5: Configure Credentials**

   * **Actor:** Developer
   * **Description:** Update config.js or .env with API keys and secrets.
   * **Outcome:** Nodes can access external APIs securely.

---

## **6. Functional Dependencies**

* Node.js runtime (v20+)
* Official n8n packages (`n8n-core`, `n8n-workflow`)
* Access to workflow JSON exports from n8n
* Environment variable management (e.g., dotenv)

---

## **7. Assumptions**

* Input JSON files are valid and exported correctly from n8n.
* All nodes used in workflows exist in n8n packages.
* Generated workflows will run on environments where Node.js and dependencies are installed.

---

## **8. Acceptance Criteria**

* System correctly parses and validates workflow JSON.
* All nodes execute as expected using imported n8n packages.
* Generated project is modular, maintainable, and can run without the n8n runtime.
* Triggers fire correctly and nodes execute in proper order.
* README.md contains proper licensing, instructions, and attribution to n8n.
* Developers can add new workflows without modifying core logic.

---

## **9. Future Enhancements**

* Support for custom/community nodes not included in official n8n packages.
* GUI or CLI for workflow selection and generation.
* Advanced logging, monitoring, and reporting of workflow execution.
* Error retry mechanisms and workflow state persistence.

✅ This FRD defines all functional aspects needed for your n8n workflow converter project.

If you want, I can **now create a combined document with PRD + FRD + step-by-step developer guide + sample folder structure** so you can hand it directly to a developer or start building yourself.

Do you want me to do that next?
