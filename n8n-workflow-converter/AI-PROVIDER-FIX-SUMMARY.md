# AI Provider Fix - Complete âœ…

## What Was Fixed

The n8n workflow converter was falling back to template-based code generation because the Edge Functions couldn't access the API keys from your local `.env.local` file. Supabase Edge Functions use their own secret management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… Updated AI Provider Helper
- Enhanced to try multiple API providers in priority order
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved template generation as robust fallback

### 2. âœ… Created Secret Management Scripts
- `scripts/setup-secrets-simple.ps1` - Simple PowerShell script
- `scripts/setup-edge-function-secrets.sh` - Bash script for Linux/macOS
- `scripts/setup-edge-function-secrets.ps1` - Full PowerShell script with checks

### 3. âœ… Configured Edge Function Secrets
Successfully set up these secrets in Supabase:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` âœ…
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` âœ… 
- `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` âœ…
- `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` âœ… (auto-generated)

### 4. âœ… Deployed Updated Edge Functions
All Edge Functions have been deployed with the new AI provider integration:
- `generate-code` - Main code generation function
- `decrypt-api-key` - API key decryption
- `encrypt-api-key` - API key encryption
- `map-nodes` - Node mapping
- `parse-workflow` - Workflow parsing

## API Provider Priority Order

The system now tries providers in this order:

1. **User's configured provider** (if they have one set up)
2. **System OpenRouter** (most reliable, supports multiple models)
3. **System Gemini** (good fallback, free tier available)
4. **Enhanced template generation** (ultimate fallback with node-specific logic)

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **READY TO USE** - Your n8n workflow converter should now generate AI-powered code instead of falling back to basic templates.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Upload a workflow JSON file** through your web interface
2. **Check the generation logs** in Supabase Dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ generate-code â†’ Logs
3. **Look for these log messages**:
   ```
   === Edge Function Secrets Status ===
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY: âœ… CONFIGURED
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY: âœ… CONFIGURED
   VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY: âœ… CONFIGURED
   API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET: âœ… CONFIGURED
   =====================================
   ```
4. **Verify AI-generated code** - The generated code should be much more sophisticated than before

## What to Expect Now

- **Better Code Quality**: AI-generated code instead of basic templates
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: If one AI provider fails, others will be tried
- **Detailed Logging**: You can see exactly which provider was used
- **Enhanced Templates**: Even the fallback templates are now node-specific and intelligent

## Monitoring

You can monitor the AI provider usage in:
- **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ Functions â†’ generate-code â†’ Logs
- **Your application logs** will show which provider was used for each generation

The fix is complete and your system should now be generating high-quality, AI-powered standalone Node.js code from your n8n workflows! ðŸŽ‰
