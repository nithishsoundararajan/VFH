# AI Provider Integration Fix - Complete Setup Guide

## Problem Summary

The n8n workflow converter was falling back to template-based code generation because:

1. **Edge Functions couldn't access local environment variables** from `.env.local`
2. **Supabase Edge Functions use their own secret management system**
3. **API keys weren't properly configured for the Edge Functions**

## Solution Overview

We've implemented a complete fix that:

1. ✅ **Updated AI provider helper** to try multiple API providers in order
2. ✅ **Enhanced template generation** as a robust fallback
3. ✅ **Created secret management scripts** to sync local env vars to Edge Functions
4. ✅ **Added proper error handling and logging** for debugging

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Secret Setup Script

Choose the appropriate script for your system:

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd n8n-workflow-converter
.\scripts\setup-edge-function-secrets.ps1
```

**For Linux/macOS (Bash):**
```bash
cd n8n-workflow-converter
chmod +x scripts/setup-edge-function-secrets.sh
./scripts/setup-edge-function-secrets.sh
```

### Step 2: Verify Secrets Were Set

```bash
npx supabase secrets list
```

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Edge Functions

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix

1. Upload a workflow JSON file
2. Check the generation logs for AI provider status
3. Verify that AI-generated code is being produced instead of templates

## What's Fixed

### Before the Fix:
- ❌ Edge Functions couldn't access API keys
- ❌ Always fell back to basic templates
- ❌ No proper error handling or logging

### After the Fix:
- ✅ Edge Functions have proper access to API keys
- ✅ Multiple AI providers with intelligent fallback
- ✅ Enhanced template generation with node-specific logic
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Testing the Fix

1. **Upload a workflow** with various node types
2. **Check the logs** to see which AI provider was used
3. **Examine the generated code** - it should be much more sophisticated than before
