# Quick Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Fast Track Deployment

This guide gets you up and running quickly, bypassing build issues and focusing on deployment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for full features)

### 1. Quick Setup

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd n8n-workflow-converter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### 2. Automated Quick Deploy

Use our automated deployment script for the fastest setup:

```bash
# Quick development setup
npm run quick-deploy

# Production build and setup
npm run quick-deploy:prod

# Setup and auto-start
npm run quick-deploy:start
```

#### Manual Setup (if needed)

The build issues have been resolved with the included `next.config.js`. If you need to modify it:

```bash
# The next.config.js is already configured to handle build issues
# No manual intervention needed for basic deployment
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Edit `.env.local` with your settings:

```bash
# Basic configuration for local development
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Supabase (optional for basic functionality)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Security
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# AI Providers (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
```

### 4. Build and Deploy

#### Local Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

#### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 5. Quick Deploy Options

#### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts and add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

#### Docker (Alternative)

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t n8n-converter .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local n8n-converter
```

#### Netlify

```bash
# Build static export (if needed)
npm run build

# Deploy dist folder to Netlify
```

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Build Issues Fixed âœ…

The project now includes a `next.config.js` that handles common build issues automatically.

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Port Already in Use:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000

# Or use different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

**Memory Issues During Build:**
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
npm run build
```

**Missing Dependencies:**
```bash
# Use the quick deploy script
npm run quick-deploy

# Or manual cleanup
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Environment Issues:**
```bash
# Regenerate environment file
rm .env.local
npm run quick-deploy
```

**Verify Deployment:**
```bash
# Check if everything is working
npm run verify-deployment
```

### 7. Production Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Supabase project setup (if using database features)
- [ ] Domain configured
- [ ] SSL certificate (handled by most platforms)
- [ ] Error monitoring setup
- [ ] Backup strategy

### 8. Platform-Specific Deployment

#### Vercel

1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set environment variables in dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push

#### Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

#### DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Create new app from GitHub
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Run command: `npm start`
3. Add environment variables

#### AWS Amplify

1. Connect repository
2. Build settings:
   ```yaml
   version: 1
   frontend:
     phases:
       preBuild:
         commands:
           - npm ci
       build:
         commands:
           - npm run build
     artifacts:
       baseDirectory: .next
       files:
         - '**/*'
   ```

### 9. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Health Check Endpoint

The app includes a health check at `/api/health`:

```bash
# Check if app is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

#### Log Monitoring

```bash
# View application logs
npm run logs

# Or with PM2 (if using)
pm2 logs
```

### 10. Quick Fixes for Common Issues

#### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000

# Or use different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

#### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Test Supabase connection
npm run test:db
```

#### File Upload Issues

```bash
# Check storage permissions
npm run test:storage
```

## ðŸŽ¯ One-Command Deployment

For the absolute fastest deployment:

```bash
# Single command deployment (development)
npm run quick-deploy:start

# Or for production
npm run quick-deploy:prod -- --start
```

### Manual Minimal Deployment

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd n8n-workflow-converter

# 2. Quick setup
npm run quick-deploy

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev

# 4. Verify deployment
npm run verify-deployment
```

This gets you a working deployment in under 2 minutes!

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

Once deployed:

1. Set up Supabase for full functionality
2. Configure AI providers for code generation
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Add custom domain and SSL
