# Download and Export Functionality Implementation

## Task 9.2: Create download and export functionality

This document outlines the implementation of the download and export functionality for the n8n Workflow Converter project.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Export Format Selection

- **ZIP Format**: Complete project as a ZIP archive (recommended)
- **TAR.GZ Format**: Complete project as a compressed tar.gz archive
- **Individual Files**: Download individual project files separately with manifest

### 2. Individual File Download Options

- **File Browser**: Browse and select individual files from generated projects
- **Selective Download**: Filter files by type (source code, documentation, tests)
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple files for batch download
- **File Manifest**: JSON manifest file listing all available files with metadata

### 3. Download History and Access Tracking

- **Complete History**: Track all downloads with timestamps and file details
- **Format Tracking**: Record which export format was used for each download
- **File Size Tracking**: Monitor storage usage and download sizes
- **Expiration Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired download links
- **Re-download Support**: Re-download from history if links are still valid

## Implementation Details

### Core Services

#### DownloadService (`src/lib/services/download-service.ts`)

- Provides file metadata and listing capabilities
- Implements security controls and file validation

### API Endpoints

#### Project Download API (`src/app/api/projects/[id]/download/route.ts`)
- GET: Download project in specified format (ZIP, TAR.GZ, individual)
- POST: Generate temporary download links with expiration
- Supports format selection and advanced options

#### Individual Files API (`src/app/api/projects/[id]/files/route.ts`)
- GET: List all individual files for a project with signed URLs
- Supports file type filtering and metadata retrieval

#### Specific File Download (`src/app/api/projects/[id]/files/[filename]/route.ts`)
- GET: Download specific individual files
- Supports direct download redirects
- Records download activity in history

#### Download History API (`src/app/api/downloads/history/route.ts`)
- GET: Retrieve user's download history with pagination
- DELETE: Clear download history (all or by date range)

### UI Components

#### ProjectDownload (`src/components/file-management/project-download.tsx`)
- Main download interface with format selection
- Advanced options for including/excluding file types
- Real-time progress tracking and error handling
- Download link generation and management

#### IndividualFileBrowser (`src/components/file-management/individual-file-browser.tsx`)
- Browse and search project files
- File type filtering and sorting options
- Bulk selection and download operations
- File size and metadata display

#### DownloadHistory (`src/components/file-management/download-history.tsx`)
- Complete download history with filtering and sorting
- Statistics and usage tracking
- History management (clear old entries, delete specific items)
- Re-download functionality for valid links

#### DownloadManager (`src/components/file-management/download-manager.tsx`)
- Unified interface combining all download functionality
- Tabbed interface for different download modes
- Context-aware display based on project selection

### Database Schema

#### Download History Table (`supabase/migrations/008_create_download_history.sql`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE download_history (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  format TEXT CHECK (format IN ('zip', 'tar.gz', 'individual')) NOT NULL,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
  downloaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Hooks and State Management

#### useDownload (`src/hooks/use-download.ts`)
- React hook for download operations
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Individual file management
- Download link generation

#### useDownloadHistory (`src/hooks/use-download.ts`)
- React hook for download history management
- History fetching with pagination
- History cleanup operations

## Security Features

### Access Control
- User authentication required for all downloads
- Project ownership verification
- Shared project access support
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### File Security
- Signed URLs with expiration times
- File type validation
- Size limits per bucket type
- Secure file path handling

### Download Tracking
- Complete audit trail of all downloads
- User-specific download history
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Privacy-compliant data handling

## Export Format Details

### ZIP Format
- Complete project archive
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Includes all selected file types
- Optimized compression

### TAR.GZ Format
- Unix-style compressed archive
- Better compression ratio
- Fallback to ZIP if not available
- Server-side conversion support

### Individual Files
- Selective file downloads
- JSON manifest with file metadata
- Batch download capabilities
- File type filtering

## Advanced Options

### File Type Selection
- **Source Code**: Include .js, .ts, and other code files
- **Documentation**: Include README.md and documentation files
- **Test Files**: Include test and spec files

### Download Preferences
- Format selection with descriptions
- Expiration time configuration
- Compression options
- Metadata inclusion

## Usage Examples

### Basic Project Download
```typescript
const { downloadProject } = useDownload();

await downloadProject('project-id', {
  format: 'zip',
  includeSource: true,
  includeDocs: true,
  includeTests: false
});
```

### Individual File Access
```typescript
const { getIndividualFiles } = useDownload();

const files = await getIndividualFiles('project-id', {
  includeSource: true,
  includeDocs: false,
  includeTests: false
});
```

### Download History Management
```typescript
const { fetchHistory, clearHistory } = useDownloadHistory();

// Get recent downloads
await fetchHistory(50);

// Clear old downloads
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);
await clearHistory(thirtyDaysAgo);
```
