# Product Overview

This project is an **n8n Workflow to Standalone Codebase Converter** that enables developers to convert n8n workflows (exported as JSON) into fully functional, standalone Node.js projects.

## Core Purpose
- Convert n8n workflow JSON files into executable Node.js codebases
- Eliminate dependency on n8n runtime for workflow execution
- Maintain compatibility with official n8n packages for node implementations
- Generate modular, maintainable code that can be deployed independently

## Key Value Propositions
- **Performance**: Run workflows without n8n runtime overhead
- **Integration**: Deploy workflows as standalone services
- **Modularity**: Generate clean, organized Node.js project structure
- **Compatibility**: Leverage official n8n packages for node logic

## Target Users
Developers who want to:
- Deploy n8n workflows as independent services
- Integrate workflow logic into existing applications
- Optimize workflow performance by removing runtime dependencies
- Maintain workflows in version control as code

## Success Criteria
- Accurate conversion of n8n JSON to executable Node.js code
- Proper data flow between nodes matching original workflow
- Secure credential management through environment variables
- Clear attribution and licensing compliance with n8n
